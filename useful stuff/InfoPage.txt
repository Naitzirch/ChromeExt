Adding a background
1. Select a scope on which to apply a background, this could be This page, All pages from 
a website, or pages corresponding to a regular expression evaluated on the domain they are
applied on where the least recently added expression has the highest priority.
(If none of the scopes is selected, choosing a background is treated as a preview)
2. Choose a background, this can be one of the presets, a colour background or a custom background.
For the custom background, find any image on the web, right click it and select "Copy image address".
Paste this address (ending in an image file extension like .png or .gif) in the custom background
field and hit Apply.

Getting Rid of a background
If a background is applied to one page only, it can be removed under the List tab
under Single Pages. Otherwise the corresponding regex can be removed under the RegEx tab.
If you want no backgrounds applied to a certain page, you can also exempt that page from
background evaluation using the Exempt button, this will add it to the Exempt pages list, here
"exempts" can also be removed again.
